InBefore404 monitors web pages for changes using Watch Threads. It saves a copy of the text each time it detects a change, as well as retrieving all of the new links.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;">First, set your preferences for download folder and update timer. Each watch thread you add will have its own sub-folder under this one.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Use the Quick Add in the Main Window, enter or paste a URL into the address box. Pressing the + button will start the downloader. A sub-folder will be created based on the address. Eg. if the address is <span style="color: #3366ff;">http://someplace.org/x/12345.html</span>, then a folder <span style="color: #3366ff;">12345</span> will be created for all of the downloads for this watch thread.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;">With an Advanced Watch, you can specify the target folder, choose a longer or shorter timer, use login credentials </span><span style="color: #000000;">to access a website, or specify the types of files you would like to retrieve. </span></li>
</ul>
The downloader will retrieve the html, and any images linked from that address. After the timer interval, it will check the URL again; and if there are any changes it will save a new html file and download any new linked images.

InBefore404 will download up to 10 items at once. The shortest timer you can set is 30 seconds. Updates and first check of new watch threads receive a higher priority than linked downlaods. You can view the download activity in the Active Downloads tab.
